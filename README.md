# Cross-platform-game-in-Flutter-with-AWS-Amplify
Building a web application using AWS services 
In this project we will be building a web application using Amplify which helps in packaging and deploying of frontend and backend codes, Flutter for building applications which compile on multiple devices, GraphQL for query manipulation and DynamoDB (NoSQL database).
<h2>What is <strong>AWS Amplify </strong>?</h2>
<p>AWS Amplify helps frontend web and mobile developers quickly build feature-rich applications without the need for deep cloud expertise.</p>
<h2>What is <strong>Flutter </strong>?</h2>
<p>
  Flutter is an open-source framework created by Google for building beautiful apps for mobile, web, desktop, and even embedded devices. Here are some key things to know about Flutter:
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform development: With Flutter, you can write code once and use it to create apps for Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. This saves developers a lot of time and effort compared to developing separate apps for each platform.
<li>Single codebase: As mentioned before, Flutter uses a single codebase for all platforms. This means you don't need to write and maintain separate codebases for different platforms.
<li>Beautiful and fast apps: Flutter apps are known for their smooth performance and attractive user interfaces. This is due to Flutter's own rendering engine, which gives developers a lot of control over the look and feel of their apps.
<li>Open-source and free: Flutter is an open-source framework, which means it's free to use and modify. This makes it a great option for both individual developers and large companies.</li>

<h2>What is <strong>GraphQL</strong> ?</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs (https://graphql.org/). It lets developers specify exactly the data they need from an API, instead of receiving everything at once. This can be more efficient and flexible than traditional REST APIs.

Here are some key points about GraphQL APIs:
<ul>
<li>Client specifies data: Unlike REST APIs where data is accessed through predefined endpoints, GraphQL uses a query language. This language allows the client (like a mobile app) to specify exactly the data it needs.
<li>Single endpoint: GraphQL APIs typically use a single endpoint for all data access. This simplifies the client-side code and avoids the need to make multiple API calls for different data.
<li>Data hierarchy: GraphQL uses a type system to define the data structure. This makes it clear what data is available and how it's related.
<li>Flexibility: Clients can request nested data in a single query, reducing the number of round trips needed to fetch data.
<li>Evolving APIs: GraphQL APIs are designed to be more adaptable to changes. New data fields can be added without breaking existing client queries.</li></ul></p>
<h2>What is <strong>DynamoDB </strong>?</h2>
<p>DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's a breakdown of what that means:
<ul>
<li>NoSQL: Unlike relational databases that use structured query language (SQL), DynamoDB is a NoSQL database. This means it stores data in a more flexible format, like key-value pairs or documents, which makes it ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data or data that doesn't fit neatly into relational tables.
<li>Cloud-based:  DynamoDB is a cloud-based service, so you don't need to manage your own database servers. This saves you time and money on infrastructure costs.
<li>Scalable:  DynamoDB is highly scalable. You can easily increase or decrease the storage and processing power of your database as your needs change.
<li>Fast performance:  DynamoDB is known for its fast performance, with single-digit millisecond response times. This makes it a good choice for applications that require real-time data access.
<li>Serverless:  DynamoDB is a serverless database, so you only pay for the resources you use. This makes it a cost-effective option for applications with varying traffic levels.</li></ul></p>
