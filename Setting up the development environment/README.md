<h2>Install Amplify CLI</h2>
Install cURL if you have not yet from the official website 
Run the following commands to install the Amplify CLI
<br>
Mac and Linux:

```
curl -sL https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/install | bash && $SHELL
```

Windows:

```
curl -sL https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/install-win -o install.cmd && install.cmd
```

<h2>Configure Amplify</h2>
The Amplify CLI requires an IAM user with appropriate policy permissions in order to interact with our AWS account. The amplify configure command will walk us through the process of creating a new user in our AWS account and store the user profile credentials in our local environment. Future commands that we run with the CLI will utilize these credentials for us to perform the actions we request.

```
amplify configure
```

amplify configure will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.
Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user. Select the region of your choice and follow the instructions.

```
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Follow the instructions at
https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#configure-the-amplify-cli

to complete the user creation in the AWS console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create
```

<h2>Creating an IAM User</h2>
Navigate to the IAM User creation page  if it's not already open.

Enter a User name and select Next. You can name the user anything but we'll call it "amplify-dev".
